This my first project from The Odin Project - Easy Version

The lesson was to create a page that looked similar to Google's. The links and buttons do not work.

Things I learned:
    1. There are many ways to do one thing.
    2. How to create a horizontal navigation for the header and footer.
    3. Took a few days trying to figure out how to split lists to have words left-aligned & right-aligned.
    4. Learned how to link a separate CSS file into an HTML file.
