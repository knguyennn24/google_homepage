This my first project from The Odin Project - Easy Version

The lesson was to create a page that looked similar to Google's. The links and buttons do not work.

Things I learned:
<ul>
    <ol>There are many ways to do one thing.</ol>
    <ol>How to create a horizontal navigation for the header and footer.</ol>
    <ol>Took a few days trying to figure out how to split lists to have words left-aligned & right-aligned.</ol>
    <ol>Learned how to link a separate CSS file into an HTML file.</ol>
